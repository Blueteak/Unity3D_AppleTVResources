Apple TV - Unity Build Resources

Versions 1.2 Release notes
- Added support for Game Center "Dashboard Artwork" 923px by 150px
This optional image, such as a game logo, appears at the top of your gameâ€™s dashboard. Transparency may be used to let the background show through the image. Dashboard artwork is not focusable. 

Versions 1.1 Release notes
- Switched from using resources to asset database so icons aren't included in the unity build
- Now supports flexible number of layers for image stacks
- Leaderboard icons added
- Added re-export menu item.
- Remove Plist Fixups as unity now does all of this

Note: When upgrading to this version you will have to reconnect your textures to the AppleTVIcons.asset as the format has changed.
