# Unity3D_AppleTVResources
Apple TV - Unity Build Resources

Versions 1.1 Release notes
-Switched from using resources to asset database so icons aren't included in the unity build
-Now supports flexible number of layers for image stacks
-Leaderboard icons added (not 100% this is correct yet, until we gamecenter UI is working correctly)
-Added re-export menu item.

Note: When upgrading to this version you will have to reconnect your textures to the AppleTVIcons.asset as the format has changed.
